## Database Schema Requirements

The following columns need to be added to the respective tables:

### Assignments Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE assignments ADD COLUMN link_url TEXT;
```

### Uploads Table (for Notes and Past Papers)
```sql
ALTER TABLE uploads ADD COLUMN link_url TEXT;
```

### Events Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN link_url TEXT;
```

## User Experience

### Form Experience
- **Optional Field**: Link field is clearly marked as "(Optional)"
- **URL Validation**: Uses `type="url"` for basic URL validation
- **Helper Text**: Each form includes contextual helper text explaining what links are for
- **Placeholders**: Relevant placeholder URLs for each content type

### Display Experience
- **Conditional Display**: Link button only appears when a link is provided
- **Consistent Design**: All link buttons use the same design pattern with Link icon
- **External Opening**: Links open in new tabs for better UX
- **Proper Spacing**: Links are positioned appropriately in the card layout

### Content Type Specific Helpers

#### Assignments
- Placeholder: `https://example.com/assignment-link`
- Helper: "Share a link to assignment resources, guidelines, or external materials"

#### Notes
- Placeholder: `https://example.com/note-resources`
- Helper: "Share a link to additional resources, online notes, or related materials"

#### Past Papers
- Placeholder: `https://example.com/past-paper-resources`
- Helper: "Share a link to additional past paper resources or solutions"

#### Events
- Placeholder: `https://example.com/event-details`
- Helper: "Share a link to event registration, additional details, or related resources"

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Users can share links instead of files when appropriate
2. **Resource Sharing**: Easy way to share external resources and materials
3. **Reduced Storage**: Links don't consume storage space
4. **Better Organization**: Links can point to organized external resources
5. **Accessibility**: Links can point to accessible versions of content
